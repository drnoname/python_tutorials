Get the list of occurrences for word, or [] if not found.
Append new location to occurrences.
Put changed occurrences into index dict; this entails a second search through the index.
In the key= argument of sorted I am not calling str.upper, just passing a reference to that method so the sorted function can use it to normalize the words for sorting
